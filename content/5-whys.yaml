description: "Divide the participants into small groups (<= 4 people) and give each group one of the top identified issues. Instructions for the group:
One person asks the others 'Why did that happen?' repeatedly to find the root cause or a chain of events
Record the root causes (often the answer to the 5th 'Why?')
Let the groups share their findings."
