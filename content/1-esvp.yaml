description: "Prepare a flipchart with areas for E, S, V, and P. Explain the concept: 
- Explorer: Eager to dive in and research what did and didn't work and how to improve.
- Shopper: Positive attitude. Happy if one good things comes out.
- Vacationer: Reluctant to actively take part but the retro beats the regular work.
- Prisoner: Only attend because they (feel they) must."
