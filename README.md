# Scrum Retrospective Planner
This a side project to build a angular project from scratch. My personal goal is to try out new angular feature and new technologies. A second goal is to help scrum masters and people who are planning a retrospective.

## Getting Started

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `node scripts/create_static_api.js` to build the content as static api.
- Run `npm run-script build` to build the project.

## Todo
- Change the UX how to select a card
- Add more content to Start
- Add [markdown support](https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown)
- Add a Tutorial and more information for each activity type
- Create more data
- Fix a performance issue for Safari
